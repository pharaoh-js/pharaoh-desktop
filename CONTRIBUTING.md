* [Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct)

* We assume a UNIX-like environment.
  - If it's broken on your Mac/BSD/Linux, please raise an issue, and I'll try to get that fixed ASAP.
  - If it's broken on your Windows machine, please raise an issue, but also consider a PR, because it won't be a priority.

* Bugs? Please file them! But first, please make sure they're a part of our app, not your environment.
  - Are you on a POSIX-ish OS?
  - Do you have Node installed?
  - Have you run `npm i`?
  - Are you running `npm start` (or `npm run dev`)?
  - If yes, please file a an issue! And if you have the time & ability, please consider helping debug this.
    - See [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs)

* Things we need:
  - A lot.
  - Top priorities are [here](doc%2Ftodo.md)
  - There's more information on what we have so far [here](doc%2Freadme.md)
  - Line endings, etc., as specified [here](.gitattributes)
  - We'd _like_ to stick to [this style](.eslintrc), but
    sometimes we're not so good at this.
    - 2 spaces, comma first, semicolon-free, keep things lined up, and a bunch of other things.
    - It's all pretty evident just from reading the code.

* Please, work on a named feature branch on your fork! It makes things a lot easier on us.
* Please, in PRs, [include details](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request).
  - (Doesn't have to be all _that_ detailed, but some info definitely helps.)
* [Commit Messages](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/)

* That's all! Really, thanks for wanting to contribute, I appreciate every little bit. You're great.

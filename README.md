# [PHARAOH](http://pharaoh.js.org)

## ABANDONED

Please use [Glitch](https://glitch.me). It's everything we wanted to make.

This is the desktop app for Pharaoh, a project started by a group of students at
[DevMountain](https://github.com/devmountain). Please see [our core
repo](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh.git) for more information on
Pharaoh.

This app is built with Electron and React.

Until this hits version 1.0, please expect breakage on any branch! If you need
something that works, get this from NPM (`npm i -g pharaoh`); those releases are
fully functional.

To get started using Pharaoh, simply `npm i -g pharaoh`, and then run `pharaoh`.
To get started hacking on it, `git clone
https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh-desktop.git`, `cd pharaoh-desktop`, and
`npm run dev` to run Pharaoh for the browser, with hot loading, then navigate to
<http://127.0.0.1:8080/>.

Please be aware that some of the npm scripts _will not work_ in a non-POSIX
environment. If you're on a Windows machine, use something that makes it
un-Windows-y.

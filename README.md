# [PHARAOH](http://pharaoh.js.org)

This is the desktop app for Pharaoh, a project started by a group of students at [DevMountain](https://github.com/devmountain). Please see [our core repo](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh.git) for more information on Pharaoh.

Until this hits version 1.0, please expect breakage on any branch!
If you need something that works, get this from NPM (`npm i -g pharaoh`); those releases are fully functional.

This app is built on [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs), using React and Firebase. To get started using Pharaoh, simply
`npm i -g pharaoh`, and then run `pharaoh`. To get started hacking on it, `git clone
https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh-desktop.git`, `cd pharaoh-desktop`, and `npm start`.

Any and all PRs welcome! Please check out [this directory](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh-desktop/tree/nwjs/doc)
and the [to-do list](https://github.com/pharaoh-js/pharaoh-desktop/blob/nwjs/doc/todo.md).

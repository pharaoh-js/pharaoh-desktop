* right now, these are the options i have available, working with nwjs:
  * notifications
  * context menu
  * tray icon/menu
  * integrated (system) file explorer
  * desktop integration (with mime-type detection, etc)

* there are some things i'm not 100% sure about (how were doing them):
  * what's the recommended way to get files from/to firebase and (real) fs?
    * streams, but there are better libs out there than just node-fs methods
  * dumping to disk: as stream? autosave on x ms? or just a button for this?
